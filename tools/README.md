## generateIcs4OpenedCfps.js

### Mission

Reads the `page/src/misc/all-cfps.json` file and generates a `developer-conference-opened-cfps.ics` file. People can then subscribe to https://developers.events/developer-conference-opened-cfps.ics to know when CFPs are closing.

Note that the generated calendar only includes CFPs which are not yet closed when the script is running.

### Usage

```sh
node generateIcs4OpenedCfps.js

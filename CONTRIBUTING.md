* Past conferences appear in the `archives/YYYY.md` file
* Add one or several events per PR with the following format:
```
* date: [Conference Name](https://example.com/) - City, state (Country)
```
* If there's an on-going Call For Proposals (CFP), please specify it at the end of the line: 
```
<a href="https://example.com/"><img alt="CFP conference-name" src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=CFP&message=until%20DD-MONTH-YYYY&color=green"></a>
```
* If the conference will be subtitles with closed captions, please specify it at the end of the line:
```
<img alt="Closed Captions" src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=CC&message=Closed%20Captions&color=blue" />
```
* Make sure the PR title is in the format of `Add Conference Name`
